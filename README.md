# HTTR - Html to rest
c# library for sending request to html websites and getting rest-like response in json format

## Use Case
Imagine you have a service which you want to get data from but it does not have any API.  
Before this library you had 2 options:
1) if it was some kind of project for fun you probably just quit
2) if it was serious project you started digging in to xpaths and end up insane

Now with this library you can just easily send request looking like rest API calls and be happy ðŸ˜Š
